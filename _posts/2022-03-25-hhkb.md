# Topre at its finest (and most portable) form

  I have so many memories from those little plastic ones...
  The first I ever got, from a guy not very far to me, was a black HHKB Pro 2. This one was the entry for me to the topre modding scene. I had the awful (then) experience to install some silence-X rings, and lube for my first time. Loved it more than I could imagine. Kept it for a bit, but after that the passion kicked in. Wanted the ivory model, more, and more, and more. Until today, I have changed more than 10 HHKB's, for no reason at all. I just like to mod and mod, again and again. 
  The recipe was known to me; purple silent sliders, 55g domes, HASU inside.... 

  _Here are some of the babes I had over the years, and took good care of... enjoy..._
