  Yes, it has been obviously a while. I let it down a bit, but a lot of things happened around, I had to do some adult things. But after a bit, I managed to be back. Not back in topre, I wish I would though, Im just back at doing some more things on MX side, something that I wanted to do for a while...

  I made some purchases lately:
  - A NCR80 cheapo,
  - A HHKB Pro 1.

  You think that those are not a lot? Wait till I explain further.

  My KFE is also upgraded with a GMK Rouge keyset, and all I can tell is that its a real babe for now. I think this is its final form ;)

  Lets take one thing at a time because my thoughts are running faster than my hands.

   **Plastic is magic**
  

I was just messing around in the "mykeyboard.eu" discord channel, looking at the deals. I had some moneys spare, due to some **HOT SALES** (I ll expand to this in a future post), so I wanted to grab something not expensive, but kinda intresting. And this because I think I need a hotswap board just to break in some swiches from time to time, and nothing beats a HS board to this.

**A wild NCR appeared**

And I acted fast, grabbed it, and had it in my hands in less than a week. First impressions were not the greatest, but it starts to grow on me, no idea why. Its a light and plastic thing, nothing more than, it has a hotswap pcb though, as I already mentioned, and also it had a Carbon Fiber plate as an extra. Not bad at all ! Building this one was fun and fast! It has 6 screws in the external shell, and some more in the internal. Quality is not here with us on this, but I don't whine at all! This board is totally a keeper.

 Building was nothing more than making the plate float with some spacers that were included in the package. Screws are a bad bunch. So many and so different, size, and quality wise. Took a while to see what goes where, and I moved on. I had some MX Blacks, the HG variant, 3 pins. Nothing great. I just did a springswap, and they are already in.

I used some C3 stabs I had already purchasec just in case I got something new to build. Honestly, I find those to be one of the safest choices out there, and they are not so hard to get, you can find them in stock almost everywhere. Maybe this one deserved a cherry pack on it, to deserve the oldschool spirit, but meh. Just used what I had in hands at this time.

I was in question for a while about what keycaps to use on it. I was somewhere in between GMK Beta js and OG Cherry. I made a try to put the beta, but as always, OG won here.

Soundwise, it is what you expect from a cheapo HS board. But this is not the point here. If you want sound, you can go metal. The recipe is already known. Here we went for an oldskool style newskool board. And they made it right. You have all the vibes you should have. The backspace hollowness is here, and this is a big deal if you are a G80 lover. If you are not, you can do lots of mods to make this board fit you. I havent tried to mod it yet. I dont think there is a serious reason to do it. I want it to look old, and feel different than the others. And its easy to achieve it.

Overall, if you need a cheap board, look no further. This is the one. You gonna be pleased more than you think!
