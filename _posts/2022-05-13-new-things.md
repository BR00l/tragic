  Yes, it has been obviously a while. I let it down a bit, but a lot of things happened around, I had to do some adult things. But after a bit, I managed to be back. Not back in topre, I wish I would though, Im just back at doing some more things on MX side, something that I wanted to do for a while...

  I made some purchases lately:
  - A NCR80 cheapo,
  - A HHKB Pro 1.

  You think that those are not a lot? Wait till I explain further.

  My KFE is also upgraded with a GMK Rouge keyset, and all I can tell is that its a real babe for now. I think this is its final form ;)

  Lets take one thing at a time because my thoughts are running faster than my hands.

    I was just messing around in the "mykeyboard.eu" discord channel, looking at the deals. I had some moneys spare, due to some *HOT SALES* (I ll expand to this in a future post), so I wanted to grab something not expensive, but kinda intresting. And this because I think I need a hotswap board just to break in some swiches from time to time, and nothing beats a HS board to this.

      And I acted fast, grabbed it, and had it in my hands in less than a week. First impressions were not the greatest, but it starts to grow on me, no idea why. Its a light and plastic things, nothing more than, it has a hotswap pcb though, as I already mentioned, and also it had a Carbon Fiber plate as an extra. Not bad at all!

      Building this one was fun and fast! It has 4 screws in the external shell, and some more in the internal. Quality is not here with us on this, but I don't whine at all! This board is totally a keeper.
