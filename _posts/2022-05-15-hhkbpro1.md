# Yes, its mint

I didnt expect this, honestly. I was just messing with some messages I had over they years on Discord, and I just stumbled at a message, talking about a mint HHKB Pro 1, with purple sliders, and no other mods. This was at 2020 if Im not mistaken... Saw it on April of 2022, and I thought : *There is not a chance this is still available!*

# Yes, it was

The guy was a person I have made a trade in the past, one of the oldschool ones, a real nice guy. We didn't said too much, you dont need to say so many things when you know what you want. Posted and, #BANG# !

I have it here, and its condition is better than some new HHKB I had in the past. Amazing, how he really could hold it that way? The trend is reversed by the way, now the yellow -from sunlight and aging- cases are all over the place and their prices are nuts too, no idea why.

Anyway, lets dive a bit in semitecnical data. Everything is different. PCB is so so different, looks so old! Also those two USB's at the back, are not there, and this is a real pleassure. What were they thinging to be honest, they are not even normal ones!

Its so clean, than it makes you wanna see it more often from behind (!@#!@#$$$).

And now the good part. Something that really needs to take time to be like this ... domes... Before I talk about them, I was always a 55g guy. In all my boards I was transplanting 55gs. NOT in this one. Those domes have aged fantastically! I dont even know if this is a word to be honest, but I can say that they are more tactile than I can remember, more than the BKE maybe, I have no words about it! So crisp, damn.

Best part of all this is that I have also the original box, with some handwriting japanese on it. I have no idea what its written on it, but its a nice perk for sure!

Sad but true is also that I feel it too tactile for me. Im using some cherry vintage MX blacks for a while now, and everything else feels ruff and tiring. 

Its a keeper for the collection though, no intention to sell, at least now!
