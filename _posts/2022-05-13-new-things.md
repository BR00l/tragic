  Yes, it has been obviously a while. I let it down a bit, but a lot of things happened around, I had to do some adult things. But after a bit, I managed to be back. Not back in topre, I wish I would though, Im just back at doing some more things on MX side, something that I wanted to do for a while...

  I made some purchases lately:
  - A NCR80 cheapo,
  - A HHKB Pro 1.

  You think that those are not a lot? Wait till I explain further.

  My KFE is also upgraded with a GMK Rouge keyset, and all I can tell is that its a real babe for now. I think this is its final form ;)
